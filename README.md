# USGS Earthquake Map
Visualizing real-time earthquake data with leaflet 


## Project Overview
Using the [USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) earthquake data API, this project uses leaflet mapping to plot out real-time earthquakes around the world. The depth and magnitude of each earthquake is referenced by the size and color of each node. Additionally, by selecting an individual earthquake, information about that event will popup on the screen.
